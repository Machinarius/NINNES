# NINNES
NINNES Is Not a NES Emulator System
## Description
Roslyn is the unsung hero of the .Net world behind most, if not all, C# and Visual Basic compilation processes. This talk aims to shine a light in the backstage of .Net and, especifically on Roslyn as the fundamental tool of every single .Net developer. How it understands code, how it compiles said code into a CLR-compatible binary, and more appliccably to the real world, how all of this can be customized for specific use cases to build Domain-Specific Languages based on C# with an imperative API. With a small focus on NES game programming, because... Why not?.
## About the Project
### What?
The NINNES project has the ultimate goal of allowing C# programmers to hit F5 on Visual Studio and see their code running on a NES emulator of their choice (not provided by the project itself) and optionally deploy to NES flash carts for execution on real hardware.

To ground such a lofty ideal the project is structured with 3 pillars: C# Code restrictions, NES dotNet Platform, C# Compilation to the NES CPU.

### How?
####  C# Code restrictions
In order to program any hardware at all the first step is to know and comply with the restrictions of said hardware's ISA (Instruction Set Architecture), memory and I/O capabilities. To ease the casual C# programmer into the limitations (particularly ISA) of the NES CPU the Roslyn C# compiler must be told to invalidate correct C# code that would make no sense or be impossible to implement in hardware within the limits of said CPU, thus a collection of Roslyn analyzers and code-fixes must be crafted to tailor the language. Visual Basic and other .Net-compatible languages are outside of the scope of this project.

Spoiler alert: Almost all of the System namespace is lost.

This pillar is the subject of the talk.

#### NES dotNet SDK/Platform
The NES has it's own particular way of doing things which must be mapped to the .Net realm, so a NuGet package providing a .Net-friendly API to elements like the CPU instructions, the PPU (Picture Processing Unit) and the APU (Audio Processing Unit) of the NES is essential to the success of the main goal. 

A mechanism to run the C# code on the standard desktop CLR with display, audio and input capabilities, similar to how XNA used to enable simple game programming, must also be included in the NuGet package so the code may be easily debugged. Direct2D, OpenGL and WebGL with WebAssembly are possible backend targets for this.

#### C# Compilation to the NES CPU
Actually outputting a valid ROM file that may run on the NES hardware from the C# code, with some possible avenues for this including:
- Code transpilation from C# 
	- To C for compilation with CC65
	- Directly outputting NES-compatible assembly code from the Roslyn code model
- MSIL recompilation with LLILC
- Researching the work of the .Net Micro Framework team

### Why?
The main objective of this project is to showcase Roslyn's flexibility for custom scenarios with an extreme case study relative to the expected use cases on the usual day to day development, so as to produce a library of Roslyn customization examples covering a wide range of scenarios. 

And for 1337 internet points, of course.

## Into the Machine
### CPUs and other Arcane things
#### Operators
The CPU is a machine designed to take sets of bytes and transform them. By using electrical mechanisms designed to operate on incoming bytes with arithmetic and logical procedures the CPU is able to perform the job the software intends for it.
#### Registers
The CPU has small named slots of ultra-fast memory to store data relevant to the execution of the instructions that comprise the program that are called registers. They are used to for temporary data relevant to the execution of both single instructions and the whole program.
Examples:
- Math operation result (Add, Subtract...)
- Integer operation overflow
- Program Counter
- Stack Pointer
#### Random Access Memory
This is a temporary storage medium that is orders of magnitude slower and bigger compared to the registers inside of the CPU and is intended to store the programs and data that is relevant to said programs.

Considering how RAM access is extremely slow to deliver data stored in itself to the CPU compared to how fast the CPU can run instructions one has to wonder how a CPU can avoid stalling execution while waiting for RAM data. To solve this problem the CPU maintains a copy of some parts of the RAM in extremely fast (but comparatively slow versus Registers) memory called Cach√©, that is tiered in levels (usually 3) scaling up in size but down in speed, yet are comparatively tiny versus the system RAM.
#### Instructions
The instructions tell the CPU what to do. Loading data from RAM into a Register, executing math on Register values and performing conditional branching are examples of simple CPU instructions.

In the most basic form of programming the instructions are usually codified according to this system:
`ADD R3 R4`
ADD being the Addition instruction, and R3 and R4 being Register names. This textual representation closely matches the final 1s and 0s that make up the instructions fed to the CPU, and it is called Assembly language.
#### Basic CPU operation
When the CPU is running it is constantly running a Fetch, Decode, Execute cycle to  run the programs stored in RAM.

Fetch refers to bringing in the next instruction for execution, storing it in the Instruction Register and increasing the Program Counter Register so the next cycle brings in the next instruction. Decode refers to priming the circuitry for the execution of said instruction and Execute refers to actually letting electricity run to the corresponding circuitry for the instruction.
#### The importance of Instructions
One could happily assume that any CPU providing instructions for basic math and conditional execution can eventually perform any task at a reasonable performance, alas, implementing complex algorithms using basic instructions (Referred to as Software Implementation) can yield extremely slow performance due to the many instructions required. CPU manufacturers regularly take a look at industry standards and publish newer CPUs with specific instructions that are implemented using dedicated electrical circuits (Referred to as Hardware Implementation) that complete the job much, much faster than generic circuits for the standard instructions.

A common example of the effect of this is early 2000 CPUs struggling to play back video with Software, compared to modern CPUs that barely have to raise their clock speed and power consumption values to do so, because most common algorithms for audio and video handling are now implemented in hardware.
